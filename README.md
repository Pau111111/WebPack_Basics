## NPM
- npm init -y (start node project with defaults)
- npm install webpack
- npm install webpack-cli
## WebPack
- webpack (file do you want to convert) example: npx webpack assets/js/main.js -o output.js
- However, it's better to automatize this process, then create the file "webpack.config.js"
- npx webpack (to execute 'webpack.config.js'). This file must be manually updated
---
- Now, for be able to export HTML,SCSS, ... files we need to install plugins
- npm i html-webpack-plugin (for compile html)
- npm i webpack-dev-server (for autocompile files). Execute it typing npx webpack-dev-server
---
- npm i style-loader
- npm i css-loader
- npm i sass-loader node-sass
- This needs a need section in webpack config called "module". Here you specify which files webpack can process
- CSS dependencys are administred in the (APP/BUNDLE/MAIN) JS file
---
- npm i jquery (you must add it in the js file)
---
- For compiling CSS you need: npm i mini-css-extract-plugin
